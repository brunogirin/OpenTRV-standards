Basic OpenTRV release numbering and procedure
=============================================
DHD20160331

Library version numbering is 'semantic' of general form major.minor.micro, see: http://semver.org/

Release procedure:
* Update release notes:
    - Make new entry with today's date and other fields filled.
    - Check pending changes all correct and present.
* Update version numbers in top-level header files.
* Check unit tests work, and update unit tests' version dependencies.
* Check compilation and run unit tests
* Update .zip file(s) for Arduino library releases.
* Tag as prerelease x.x.x-RC1 (eg 1.0.0-RC1).  No leading "V" or "v".
    - release title should be the same as the tag.
    - release description should include what the release is and why.
* Once all libs are prereleased and tested, new release of OpenTRV main repo can be made against them.
* Retag all libs as x.x.x and create x.x.x-production-branch in each library and OpenTRV repo.










A sample of typical release notes follows, typically in in a plain text file called
RELEASES_<LIBNAME>.txt:

    freezepoint name: V1.0
    branch name: HEAD
    Deployed where: Production
    Changes since last freezepoint (developer/mgr initials and brief description):
    Previous significant freezepoint: V0.9

    DE20151023:  Added unit tests for OTNullRadioLink.
    DE20151026:  Fixed compiler warning due to preinit().
    DE20151103:  Updated nullRadio.
    DHD20151222: created FrameType_Secureable enum and 'secure frame types' header.
    DHD20160117: moved simple CRC support from OTRadioLink to OTV0P2BASE.
    DHD20160131: added dynamic channel-switching support to RFM23B, with 57600bps GFSK packet-handling config.
    DHD20160303: TODO-721: separating out V0p2=specific secure frame impl details (such as EEPROM storage of msg counters).
    DHD20160325: COH-80: support for TX IDs other than local node ID.
    DE20160331:  Fixed bug preventing compilation when using ISRRXQueue1Deep

20151021:
    freezepoint name: V0.9
    branch name: HEAD
    Deployed where: 16WW (released copy on GitHub https://github.com/DamonHD/OTRadioLink V0.8).
    Changes since last freezepoint (developer/mgr initials and brief description):
    Previous significant freezepoint: V0.8
    DHD20150817: issues still pending: TX level control, support for multiple channels, RX filter signature.
    DHD20150820: starting V0.9...
    DHD20150821: repo transferred from DamonHD to OpenTRV a/cs on GitHub.
    DHD20150821: commit/push after repo transfer...
    DHD20150920: TODO-547: deprecating use of IDLE mode after more trouble seen on REV1 boards.
    DHD20150920: TODO-547: same issue seen without use of IDLE when polling fast.
    DHD20150922: TODO-547: may be an SPI issue (REV1 uses SCK for LED), not IDLE, so running SPI slower by default.
    DHD20150922: TODO-547: still crashing, but had not correctly enabled delays around nSS.
    DHD20150924: Allowing radio code to at least compile on UNO.
    DE20151014:  Created null radio implementation

20150817:
    freezepoint name: V0.8
    branch name: HEAD
