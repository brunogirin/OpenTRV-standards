Basic OpenTRV release numbering and procedure
=============================================
DHD20160331

Library version numbering is 'semantic' of general form major.minor.micro, see: http://semver.org/

Release procedure:
* Update release notes:
    - Make new entry with today's date and other fields filled.
    - Check pending changes all correct and present.
* Update version numbers in top-level header files.
* Check unit tests work, and update unit tests' version dependencies.
* Check compilation and run unit tests
* Update .zip file(s) for Arduino library releases.
* Tag as prerelease x.x.x-RC1 (eg 1.0.0-RC1).  No leading "V" or "v".
    - release title should be the same as the tag.
    - release description should include what the release is and why.
* Once all libs are prereleased and tested, new release of OpenTRV main repo can be made against them.
* Retag all libs as x.x.x and create x.x.x-production-branch in each library and OpenTRV repo.
